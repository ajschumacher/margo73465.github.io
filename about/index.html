	Hello, my name is Margo Smith. I am an aspiring data scientist and data visualization designer. I created this website in an effort to improve my HTML and web design skills as well as to showcase my data visualization work. I have experience working with Illustrator, R, D3 for data visualization, as well as R, Python, and Matlab for data analysis. Currently, I am employed as a computational modeler at Weill Cornell Medical College in the <a id="lab_link" href="http://christinilab.org">Christini lab</a>. In this position I am responsible for creating and using models of human atrial myocytes to investigate the causes of atrial fibrillation. This work involves generates a significant amount of data, which I am responsible for analyzing and presenting to the rest of the lab in a simple and understandable format. I have found that this is the portion of my job that I most enjoy, so I am looking for positions in which the analysis and presentation of data are the primary focus. I am also interested in freelance opportunities. You can find a copy of my resume <a id="resume_link" href="resume_october_2013.pdf"> here</a>.
